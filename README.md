# Social-Network-API

## Description

This project is a social network web application API where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list. The API is built using Express.js for routing, MongoDB for the database, and Mongoose as the ODM (Object Data Modeling) library. This project mimics some of the core functionalities of popular social networking platforms, focusing on efficient data handling and flexibility.

## Usage
